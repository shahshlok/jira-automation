# Jira Automation Dashboard - Experimental Caching Branch

## Context for AI Agents

This document provides comprehensive context about performance and scalability problems in our Jira automation dashboard. Use this information to understand the current system constraints and help devise effective caching strategies.

## Project Overview

This experimental branch addresses critical performance and scalability issues in a Jira automation dashboard that currently suffers from inefficient data retrieval patterns and excessive API usage.

## The Problem

### 1. Excessive API Calls Per User Interaction
Every time a user selects a project in the dashboard, the system triggers multiple separate API calls:
- One call to fetch epics for the selected project
- Another call to fetch stories within those epics  
- Additional calls to fetch test cases for each story
- Separate calls for any additional metadata or project details

This results in 4-6 API calls for a single user action that should ideally require cached data.

### 2. Complete Absence of Caching
The current system has zero caching mechanisms in place:
- Every user navigation triggers fresh API calls to Jira
- Repeated requests for the same data occur constantly
- No data persistence between user sessions or even within the same session
- Identical API responses are fetched multiple times within minutes

### 3. Performance Degradation Impact
Users experience significant delays throughout their workflow:
- **Loading delays**: 2-5 second waits for each project selection
- **Navigation sluggishness**: Every dashboard interaction requires network round-trips
- **Compound delays**: Global search functionality requires fetching data across all projects simultaneously
- **User frustration**: Poor user experience due to constant loading states

### 4. API Rate Limiting Risk
The high frequency of API calls creates several risks:
- **Jira rate limits**: Risk of hitting Atlassian's API rate limits (typically 300-1000 requests per minute)
- **Service interruption**: Potential for the dashboard to become unusable if rate limits are exceeded
- **Scaling impossibility**: Current approach cannot support multiple concurrent users
- **Vendor relationship risk**: Excessive API usage could strain relationship with Atlassian services

### 5. Resource Inefficiency
The current data access patterns are highly inefficient:
- **Network waste**: Repeated transmission of identical data
- **Server resource drain**: Backend constantly processing redundant requests
- **Database overhead**: If any local storage is involved, it's being hit unnecessarily
- **Memory waste**: No intelligent data retention between requests

### 6. Data Freshness vs Performance Trade-off
The system currently prioritizes data freshness at the cost of performance:
- Projects data (rarely changes) is fetched as frequently as story data (changes more often)
- No differentiation between high-change and low-change data types
- Global search requires fresh fetches of all data every time
- No intelligent refresh strategies based on data volatility

### 7. Scalability Bottleneck
The current architecture cannot scale:
- **Single user limitation**: Performance degrades significantly with just one active user
- **Multi-user impossibility**: Multiple concurrent users would quickly exhaust API limits
- **Growth barrier**: Adding features or expanding user base is blocked by these fundamental issues
- **Maintenance overhead**: No visibility into API usage patterns or performance metrics

## Business Impact

This inefficient data retrieval system creates several business problems:
- **User adoption barriers**: Poor performance prevents user engagement
- **Development velocity**: New features are constrained by existing performance issues  
- **Operational costs**: Excessive API usage leads to higher vendor costs
- **Reliability concerns**: System fragility due to external API dependency
- **Competitive disadvantage**: Slow tools reduce team productivity

## Current System Architecture

The dashboard is built with:
- **Frontend**: Next.js React application with TypeScript
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes handling Jira integration
- **Data Flow**: Direct API calls to Jira REST APIs for each user interaction
- **State Management**: Client-side state with no persistence layer
- **Authentication**: Atlassian OAuth integration

## Key Data Types and Access Patterns

### Projects Data
- **Change Frequency**: Very low (projects are created/modified infrequently)
- **Access Pattern**: High frequency (accessed on every dashboard load)
- **Size**: Small to medium (typically 10-50 projects per organization)
- **Current Behavior**: Fetched on every page load

### Epics Data  
- **Change Frequency**: Low to medium (epics updated weekly/monthly)
- **Access Pattern**: Medium frequency (accessed when project is selected)
- **Size**: Medium (10-100 epics per project)
- **Current Behavior**: Fetched every time a project is selected

### Stories Data
- **Change Frequency**: Medium to high (stories updated daily)
- **Access Pattern**: High frequency (core dashboard functionality)
- **Size**: Large (100-1000+ stories per project)
- **Current Behavior**: Fetched every time a project/epic is selected

### Test Cases Data
- **Change Frequency**: Low to medium (test cases relatively stable)
- **Access Pattern**: Medium frequency (accessed per story)
- **Size**: Very large (multiple test cases per story)
- **Current Behavior**: Fetched individually for each story

### Global Search Data
- **Requirements**: Needs access to all projects, epics, and stories simultaneously
- **Current Behavior**: Triggers bulk API calls across all data types
- **Performance Impact**: Most resource-intensive operation

## Technical Constraints

- **Jira API Rate Limits**: 300-1000 requests per minute depending on plan
- **Network Latency**: API calls to Atlassian servers introduce 200-500ms delays
- **Data Consistency**: Some tolerance for slightly stale data is acceptable
- **User Expectations**: Users expect sub-second response times for navigation
- **Infrastructure**: Currently deployed on serverless/edge computing platforms

## Success Criteria for Caching Strategy

Any proposed solution should address:
1. **Reduce API calls by 70-90%** while maintaining data freshness
2. **Improve response times** from 2-5 seconds to sub-second
3. **Enable multi-user scalability** without hitting rate limits
4. **Maintain data consistency** with acceptable staleness thresholds
5. **Provide fallback mechanisms** when cache is unavailable

Use this context to recommend appropriate caching strategies, implementation approaches, and architectural patterns that align with our technical constraints and business requirements.
